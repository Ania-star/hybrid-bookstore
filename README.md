# ðŸ“š Hybrid Bookstore Database System

A hybrid bookstore system that combines the strengths of relational (SQL) and non-relational (MongoDB) databases.  
Users can browse, order, and review books â€” while admins monitor customer locations and activities through dashboards.  
Built using **Streamlit** for a lightweight, interactive web interface.
